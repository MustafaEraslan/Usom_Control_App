Desktop application design that filters and logs malicious IP addresses

Hello Coder!

I designed a desktop application with the information I got from the BTK Academy portal cyber security course.

So how does the application work?

The application is querying for the address received from the user. It scans for malicious IP and saves it in a text document.

thanks for viewing.
